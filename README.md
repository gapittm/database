To create all the components of this project, I utilized HTML 5 mixed with PHP. All interaction goes through HTML forms, which the PHP scripts then process before displaying the tabulated result in a separate window. Of course, programming in PHP for the first time led to some odd code bits, some of which have yet to replace (they function perfectly fine, but are rather unwieldy).
All queries, with the exception of those relating to accounts, open a new tab in the browser. It makes comparing two separate queries and styling them within the page much easier.
